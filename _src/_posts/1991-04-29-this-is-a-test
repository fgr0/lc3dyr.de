This page offers a brief overview of what itâ€™s like to use Markdown. The syntax page provides complete, detailed documentation for every feature, but Markdown should be very easy to pick up simply by looking at a few examples of it in action. The examples on this page are written in a before/after style, showing example syntax and the HTML output produced by Markdown.

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

Now lets test a list:
-   Candy.
-   Gum.
-   Booze.

This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

    <blockquote>
            <p>For example.</p>
    </blockquote>

    {% highlight python %}
    def test:
        """this is a test"""
        pass
    {% endhighlight %}
